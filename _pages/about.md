<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am an undergraduate student pursuing a B.Sc. in Computational Data Science at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, with an expected graduation in May 2027. My research interests focus on multimodal large language models (MLLMs), spatial reasoning, reinforcement learning in games, and motion capture technology for sports assessment.

Currently, I am involved in multiple research projects spanning computer vision, natural language processing, and machine learning. I have experience working with token-level reinforcement learning algorithms, benchmarking spatial reasoning abilities of MLLMs, and developing automated benchmarks for game-based RL generalization.

I am passionate about advancing the field of artificial intelligence, particularly in areas where computer vision meets language understanding, and I enjoy tackling challenging problems that push the boundaries of current technology.
